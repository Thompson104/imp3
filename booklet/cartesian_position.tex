\section{Approaching phase controller}
As explained in the section \ref{sec:task_division} before the execution of the dragging phase
a preliminar approaching phase is required  to move the hand near the object of interest.
\par
In principle the HIC controller could also be used to perform this task but in practice
some issues due to the singularity introduced by the Euler ZYZ parametrization and due to the
joints limits make that controller useful during the dragging phase only where short movements are executed
and the attitude is carefully commanded to avoid the singularity issue.
So another controller was developed using a joint space approach so that large movements can be performed.

\subsection{Design of a joint space point to point controller}
The alternative controller was developed combining an inverse dynamics controller in joint
space with an inverse kinematics solver.
\par
By substituing a command torque of the form
\[
\vec{\tau} = C(\vec{q}, \dot{\vec{q}}) \dot{\vec{q}} + \vec{G}(\vec{q}) + B(\vec{q}) \vec{a}
\]
in the joint space dynamics of the manipulator
\[
  B(\vec{q})\ddot{\vec{q}} + C(\vec{q}, \dot{\vec{q}}) \dot{\vec{q}} + \vec{G}(\vec{q}) = \vec{\tau}
\]
the following results
\[
\ddot{\vec{q}} = \vec{a}_{p2p}
\]
where $\vec{a}_{p2p}$ is the new input vector.
\par
In order to move the hand from the previous configuration $\vec{q}_{prev}$
to a new one expressed as a position in cartesian coordinates $\vec{p}_{ee}$ and
an orientation $\prescript{b}{}{R}_{ee}$ a joint space trajectory was generated
\[
q_{des}^{i}(t) = a_0 + a_1 t + a_2 t^2 + a_3 t^3 + a_4 t^4 + a_5 t^5
\]
with boundary conditions
\[
\begin{split}
  &q_{des}^{i}(0) = q_{prev}^{i} \quad \dot{q}_{des}^{i}(0) = 0 \quad \ddot{q}_{des}^{i}(0) = 0\\
  &q_{des}^{i}(t_f) = q_{f}^{i} \quad \dot{q}_{des}^{i}(t_f) = 0 \quad \ddot{q}_{des}^{i}(t_f) = 0
\end{split}
\]
where $\vec{q}_{f}$ is given by an inverse kinematics solver
\[
\vec{q}_{f} = FK^{-1}(\vec{p}_{ee,des},\prescript{b}{}{R}_{ee,des})
\]
and is discarded whenever its components exceed the joints limits.
\par
In order to execute the trajectory an input vector of the form
\[
\vec{a}_{p2p} = \ddot{\vec{q}}_{des} + K_d(\dot{\vec{q}}_{des} - \dot{\vec{q}}) + K_p(\vec{q}_{des} - \vec{q})
\]
was used where $K_p$ and $K_d$ are positive definite matrices.
