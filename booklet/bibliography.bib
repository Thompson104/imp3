abstract = {A new conceptually simple approach to controlling compliant motions of a robot manipulator is presented. The “hybrid” technique described combines force and torque information with positional data to satisfy simultaneous position and force trajectory constraints specified in a convenient task related coordinate system. Analysis, simulation, and experiments are used to evaluate the controller's ability to execute trajectories using feedback from a force sensing wrist and from position sensors found in the manipulator joints. The results show that the method achieves stable, accurate control of force and position trajectories for a variety of test conditions.},

@article{Anderson1988,
abstract = {The inclusion of force information in the control of robots increases their adaptability to uncertain environments, such as are found in deburring, grinding, and assembly tasks. The authors present a foundation for force control strategies, in view of the fact that the type of control strategy that is employed depends fundamentally on the characteristics of the environment. A general control approach is introduced, called hybrid impedance control which in its simplest forms reduces the operational space control of O. Khatib and J. Burdick (1986), or to N. Hogan's (1985) impedance control. The control law is formulated in a general enough fashion, however, to allow for higher order controllers},
